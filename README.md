This Jenkins pipeline automates the complete CI/CD lifecycle for a Java-based application, ensuring faster, secure, and high-quality software delivery. It begins by checking out the source code from a GitHub repository and extracting the Git commit hash to uniquely tag the Docker image. The pipeline then uses Maven to clean and compile the code, followed by executing unit tests to validate application functionality. Next, it integrates with SonarQube to perform static code analysis, checking for bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, and maintainability issues. A quality gate is enforced to ensure only high-standard code proceeds to the next stages.

Once the code passes quality checks, the pipeline packages the application as a .jar file and uploads it to JFrog Artifactory for secure artifact storage and versioning. A Docker image is then built using the packaged application and tagged with the Git commit for traceability. The Docker image is pushed to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), making it ready for deployment in container orchestration platforms like EKS or ECS. To complete the workflow, Slack notifications are triggered on build success or failure, keeping the team informed in real-time. This pipeline demonstrates a robust, cloud-native, and production-ready DevOps process, integrating best-in-class tools like Jenkins, SonarQube, JFrog, AWS ECR, and Slack.
